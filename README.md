“Flatten the Curve”-
> The goal of this is to reduce the epidemic and halt the spread. Trying to reduce the number of cases that are going on actively at that point of time, which in turn gives the doctors and govt to be prepared and respond to the situation.
>The more people reporting with the virus on a given day, the higher the curve; a high curve means the virus is spreading fast. A low curve shows that the virus is spreading slower
